Here are some examples for you. Each example has a claim, a table, and a table caption as inputs, and the action plan as output. I’ll show you how to think through the process step by step without deciding the final verdict.

Example 1:
Claim: The average sales in Q1 was higher than Q2.
Table: {
     "quarter": ["Q1", "Q1", "Q1", "Q2", "Q2", "Q2", "Q3", "Q3"],
     "sales": [100, 150, 120, 90, 110, 95, 100, 100],
     "expense": [500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200]
}
Caption: Average Sales of different quarters at Company X (unit: dollar)

<think>
To verify if the average sales in Q1 exceed those in Q2, we need to calculate and compare the average sales for each quarter based on the "sales" column. The "expense" column isn’t relevant here.
</think>
Action Plan:
1. Extract all sales values for Q1 from the "sales" column where "quarter" is "Q1".
2. Compute the average sales for Q1 by summing these values and dividing by the count.
3. Extract all sales values for Q2 from the "sales" column where "quarter" is "Q2".
4. Compute the average sales for Q2 by summing these values and dividing by the count.
5. Compare the Q1 average with the Q2 average to determine which is higher.

Example 2:
Claim: Our method performs the best compared to all the baselines.
Table: {
     "Method": ["Baseline-1", "Baseline-2", "Baseline-3", "SD (Our method)"],
     "BLEU Score": [30, 35, 35, 39],
     "Rouge Score": [50, 55, 59, 57]
}
Caption: Comparison of baselines against our model on Dataset X.

<think>
To check if "SD (Our method)" outperforms all baselines, we need to compare its BLEU and Rouge scores against each baseline’s scores. Both metrics should be higher for SD to support the claim of best performance.
</think>
Action Plan:
1. Extract the BLEU score for "SD (Our method)" and each baseline from the "BLEU Score" column.
2. Compare SD’s BLEU score with each baseline’s BLEU score to check if it’s the highest.
3. Extract the Rouge score for "SD (Our method)" and each baseline from the "Rouge Score" column.
4. Compare SD’s Rouge score with each baseline’s Rouge score to check if it’s the highest.
5. Determine if SD has the highest scores in both BLEU and Rouge compared to all baselines.

Here are some examples for you. Each example has a claim, a table, a table caption, and an action plan from the Planner agent as inputs. The output is the execution process and a verdict: "support", "refute", or "not verifiable info".

Example 1:
Claim: The average sales in Q1 was higher than Q2.
Table: {
     "quarter": ["Q1", "Q1", "Q1", "Q2", "Q2", "Q2"],
     "sales": [100, 150, 120, 90, 110, 95],

1. Extract all sales values for Q1 from the "sales" column where "quarter" is "Q1".
2. Compute the average sales for Q1 by summing these values and dividing by the count.
3. Extract all sales values for Q2 from the "sales" column where "quarter" is "Q2".
4. Compute the average sales for Q2 by summing these values and dividing by the count.
5. Compare the Q1 average with the Q2 average to determine which is higher.

<explanation>
Step 1: Q1 sales values are [100, 150, 120].
Step 2: Q1 average = (100 + 150 + 120) / 3 = 370 / 3 = 123.33.
Step 3: Q2 sales values are [90, 110, 95].
Step 4: Q2 average = (90 + 110 + 95) / 3 = 295 / 3 = 98.33.
Step 5: Compare 123.33 with 98.33. Since 123.33 > 98.33, the claim holds true.
