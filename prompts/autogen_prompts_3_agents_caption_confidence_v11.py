Here are some examples for you. Each example has a claim, a table, and a table caption as inputs, and the action plan as output. I’ll show you how to think through the process step by step without deciding the final verdict.

Example 1:
Claim: The average sales in Q1 was higher than Q2.
Table: {
     "quarter": ["Q1", "Q1", "Q1", "Q2", "Q2", "Q2", "Q3", "Q3"],
     "sales": [100, 150, 120, 90, 110, 95, 100, 100],
     "expense": [500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200]
}
Caption: Average Sales of different quarters at Company X (unit: dollar)

<think>
To verify if the average sales in Q1 exceed those in Q2, we need to calculate and compare the average sales for each quarter based on the "sales" column. The "expense" column isn’t relevant here.
</think>
Action Plan:
1. Extract all sales values for Q1 from the "sales" column where "quarter" is "Q1".
2. Compute the average sales for Q1 by summing these values and dividing by the count.
3. Extract all sales values for Q2 from the "sales" column where "quarter" is "Q2".
4. Compute the average sales for Q2 by summing these values and dividing by the count.
5. Compare the Q1 average with the Q2 average to determine which is higher.

Example 2:
Claim: Our method performs the best compared to all the baselines.
Table: {
     "Method": ["Baseline-1", "Baseline-2", "Baseline-3", "SD (Our method)"],
     "BLEU Score": [30, 35, 35, 39],
     "Rouge Score": [50, 55, 59, 57]
}
Caption: Comparison of baselines against our model on Dataset X.

<think>
To check if "SD (Our method)" outperforms all baselines, we need to compare its BLEU and Rouge scores against each baseline’s scores. Both metrics should be higher for SD to support the claim of best performance.
</think>
Action Plan:
1. Extract the BLEU score for "SD (Our method)" and each baseline from the "BLEU Score" column.
2. Compare SD’s BLEU score with each baseline’s BLEU score to check if it’s the highest.
3. Extract the Rouge score for "SD (Our method)" and each baseline from the "Rouge Score" column.
4. Compare SD’s Rouge score with each baseline’s Rouge score to check if it’s the highest.
5. Determine if SD has the highest scores in both BLEU and Rouge compared to all baselines.

Example 3:
Claim: Model X suffers in performance as input size increases.
Table: {"Input Size": [10, 20, 30], "Accuracy": [90, 85, 80]}
Caption: Model X performance metrics
<think>
The term "suffers" is unclear—likely means a decline in accuracy, but could vary in magnitude. The table provides accuracy for three input sizes, sufficient to check a trend.
</think>
Action Plan:
1. Extract accuracy values for each input size.
2. Check if accuracy decreases as input size increases from 10 to 30.
3. Define "suffers" as a consistent drop in accuracy across all steps.

# verifier_agent_system_message = '''You are an expert Verifier Agent. Your role is to determine whether the given claim can be verified using the provided table, table caption, and column headers. Follow these steps:
#
# 1. **Analyze Claim and Data**: Carefully interpret the table data:
#    - Recognize that columns like "# words (summary)" paired with "# pairs" typically represent averages, not totals.
#    - Interpret statistical placeholders (e.g., "***" as p < 0.001) and use all available metrics (e.g., t-values, precision scores) for comparisons.
#    - Use relative change data (e.g., "cmp." rows) to analyze performance differences.
#
# 2. **Enhance Ambiguous Claims**: If the claim is ambiguous (e.g., contains unclear terms like "effective," "different," "interpretability"), enhance it with precise, contextually reasonable definitions or assumptions:
#    - Define "effective" as performance in at least one key metric, unless specified otherwise (e.g., "across all metrics").
#    - Define "different results" as statistically significant differences (e.g., t-values > ±1.96 for p < 0.05) in key metrics.
#    - Define "interpretability" using proxy metrics like precision or answerability when direct metrics are unavailable.
#    - Define "most setups" as "at least 3 out of 4 setups" if the table lists 4 setups.
#    - Define "deficit" as the gap between best and worst baselines.
#    Document these enhancements in your response.
#
# 3. **Determine Verifiability**: A claim is verifiable if the table provides relevant data (or data that can be computed) to support or refute it, even with assumptions or proxy metrics. A claim is unverifiable only if the table lacks relevant data entirely or is irrelevant to the claim’s context.
#
# 4. **Handle Mixed Results**: For claims asserting inferiority (e.g., "not as effective"), if performance is equal or better in most metrics, the claim can be refuted unless it specifies uniform underperformance. Evaluate the claim’s overall intent, not just isolated metrics.
#
# 5. **Response Format**:
#    - If unverifiable, return "<explanation>Detailed reasoning on why the claim cannot be verified...</explanation>\nnot enough info" to terminate the chat.

verifier_agent_system_message = '''You are an expert Verifier Agent tasked with determining whether a claim from a scientific research paper can be verified as true or false using only the provided table, table caption, and column headers, presented as a simple Pandas dataframe. A claim is "not verifiable" (NEI) only if it is fluent, logical, and relevant to the table but cannot be confirmed or contradicted solely based on the table’s information due to missing or insufficient data. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Partial Verifiability**: If the claim can be partially supported or refuted with the table data, proceed to the planner agent for further analysis, even if not all aspects are directly verifiable.
2. **Compound Claims**: For claims with multiple parts, check if the table verifies at least one part. If the remaining part can be reasonably inferred (with some certainty) from the verifiable portion, proceed to the planner agent. If not, return "not enough info."
3. **Ambiguity Resolution**: Be smart about interpreting ambiguous terms using table context:
   a) Match similar terms (e.g., "Hybrid model" in the claim to "Hybrid" in a row header) if the table compares models and context aligns.
   b) If the claim references a general term (e.g., "BERT model") and the table lists variants (e.g., "BERT-1," "BERT-2"), infer it refers to those rows.
   c) Use column headers to interpret cell contents (e.g., "Model" column implies model names; "Dataset Feature" implies dataset attributes).
   d) For subjective terms (e.g., "significant," "effective"), resolve them with table data if possible (e.g., numerical differences) or proceed to the planner agent—do not default to NEI due to ambiguity alone.
4. **Data Sufficiency Check**: If data seems insufficient or cells appear empty, double-check the table, focusing on correct rows and columns based on headers and claim context, to ensure no relevant data is overlooked.
5. **Scientific Context**: Leverage knowledge of research paper writing styles (e.g., claims often compare models, methods, or datasets in tables) to guide interpretation.

**Response Format**:
- If not verifiable: "<explanation>Detailed reasoning on why the claim cannot be verified with the table data...</explanation>\nnot enough info" (terminate chat).
